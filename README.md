# Creating a Portfolio!
I wanted to create a portfolio as I wanted to make something which could be beneficial for me in the future when I apply for a job. I intend for job recruitors to be able to gauge my skill level based on the drawings which I have used in this website to determine if my skill level and proficiency is what the company is looking for when they do see my website.

Furthermore, the website itself also shows another skill which I have learnt and used which can show my job recruitors that I have skills beyond what I have shown in pictures in the website itself.

# Anna's Black and White Invoking Visuals
My project involves someone who has a fascination for the colours black and white. Hence they make many thought provoking drawings through them.

# Design Process
During the design process, I wanted to make a portfolio. A portfolio allows someone some level of creativity to showcase their works and hence I wanted to try my hands at it so that some day I may make my own portfolio website. The website is targetted towards job recruitors and contractors who are looking for someone who is suitable for the job. These recruitors or contractors would want skilled individuals who can uplift a company's reputation through different fields of work such as marketing, product creation, etc. My project would help these people to determine whether the works done are suitable for these jobs and ways to contact the person if they are suitable for the job.

I also considered what are the needs of the users which I had in mind for my website and came up with these user stories:

As a job recruitor, I would want to see the works done by the person who made their portfolio so that I can determine if they are suitable for the job.

As a viewer, I would like to have easy access to the navigation bar so that I can easily view the works done by the person to reference their works.

As a job recruitor, I would like to be able to easily contact the person if their portfolio is suitable for the job to recruit them and discuss more details on a job or contract.

As a job recruitor, I would like to view their works easily so that I can see if the person has the necessary skills needed for the job to ensure that the company's appearance remains strong.

# Features
In this section, I will be talking more about the features which are available on the website and whats more to come!

# Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Feature 1 - In all my pages, I have a connecting navigation bar. This navigation bar allows viewers to access all three of the html pages easily as it is fixed to the players screen whenever they scroll up and down. 

Feature 2 - In all my pages, I also have a footer. The footer allows viewers to easily contact the person via social media if they are interested in her works and would like to know her rates. 

Feature 3 - I made use of image galleries to allow viewers to easily view the artworks on the website by clicking through them should they be on their phones viewing the website. 

Feature 4 - I made use of carousels to allow viewers to easily see artworks without having to click through them.

Feature 5 - People on computers and laptops can see the smaller image gallery if they do not want to see an enlarged version of the image currently showing in the carousel.

# Features Left to Implement
Feature 1 - A way to link social media pages to the icons in the footer so that viewers can easily contact the person if they are interested in her works.

Feature 2 - A way to link the footer menu to other pages in the website to allow viewers to get more information on the person to determine if they are suitable for a job position which is currently available at the moment.

# Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

HTML: Was used to connect the bridge between CSS and Javascript. Is what the viewer sees when they open a website.

CSS: Used to make the website more aesthetically pleasing. 

JavaScript: Was used to make some features within the website functionable. Acts as the skeleton of the website.

# Testing

Social Media Buttons (Twitter, Facebook, etc.):
Go to the footer of the page
Click onto one of the social media buttons
Button should take viewers to the person's social media accounts

Footer Menu:
Go to the footer of the page
Click onto one of the listed items in the menu
Listed item should take viewers to the page of that menu

Navigation Bar:
Go to the navigation bar
Click onto one of the buttons in the bar
The buttons should take viewers to the webpage of their choice
When shrunk, the buttons are hidden in a hamburger icon which viewers can click on to access the different pages in the website.

Image Gallery:
Go to either Illustrations.html or Sketches.html
Go to the Image Gallery
Click onto the arrow top view images
When shrunk, the images in the smaller gallery becom smaller whilst the big gallery remains big.

Bugs:
A bug that I am currently facing is that my social media buttons and footer menu do not bring my viewers to their designated location when they click the buttons. 
My Image Galleries also do not individually move but instead take turns between each gallery to automatically scroll through in the website.
