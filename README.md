# Creating a Portfolio!
I wanted to create a portfolio as I wanted to make something which could be beneficial for me in the future when I apply for a job. I intend for job recruitors to be able to gauge my skill level based on the drawings which I have used in this website to determine if my skill level and proficiency is what the company is looking for when they do see my website.

Furthermore, the website itself also shows another skill which I have learnt and used which can show my job recruitors that I have skills beyond what I have shown in pictures in the website itself.
